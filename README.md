# Machine-Learning-to-Read-Handwritten-Digits
Machine learning program in python using 1-nearest neighbor to predict values of handwritten digits. Using euclidean and cosine distance formulas to select nearest neighbor, a prediction is made. Multiple tests are used to see what the optimum number of tests and training units used should be.
